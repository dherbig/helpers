> python -m virtualenv djangoEnv
> call djangoEnv/scripts/activate

django-admin startproject main

Navigate into the main directory that you just created.
	> cd main
Make a new apps directory
	> mkdir apps
Navigate into apps
	> cd apps
Create an __init__.py file in apps
	nul> __init__.py <-- You can disregard the Access Denied message
Start the new app.
	> python ../manage.py startapp first_app

Open the settings.py file an add a line to your INSTALLED_APPS:

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'apps.first_app', ### <= added this line!
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    ]

Open the urls.py file, add the line to import include and add a line to include all of the url routes from our app into the main app's url routes.

    from django.conf.urls import url, include # Notice we added include
    from django.contrib import admin
    urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^', include('apps.first_app.urls')) # And now we use include to pull in our first_app.urls...
    ]

Now, create the urls.py file in our 'first_app' folder

Add some routes to our urls.py file!
In Django we set up our routes this way:

	from django.conf.urls import url
	from . import views
	# ^ So we can call functions from our routes!
	urlpatterns = [
		url(r'^$', views.index)
	]

Finally, run the app:
	cd ..
	python manage.py runserver

Adding views & static files
	Folder: main
		Folder: apps <= created by our steps above
		File: __init__.py <= created by our steps above
		Folder: first_app <= created as a result to the call to 'startapp'
			Folder: templates
				Folder: first_app
					Files: *.html
				Folder: static
					Folder: first_app
						Folder: css
						Folder: js
						Folder: images
					File: __init__.py
					File: admin.py
					File: apps.py
					File: models.py <= The 'M' in MVC
					File: tests.py
					File: views.py <= The CONTROLLER in our MVC pattern
					urls.py <= the file that will handle the routes of our app
				File: manage.py <= used to run the application.
				Folder: main <= contains the files specific to our app.
					File: __init__.py
					File: settings.py
					File: urls.py
					File: wsgi.py


Example of a Controller action ('View' in Django:)
        # views.py
        ...
        def index(request):
         return render(request, "first_app/index.html")

Implement sessions in our app:
        # Need to be in same directory as manage.py file
        > python manage.py makemigrations
        > python manage.py migrate

Context

On the server:
        from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse, redirect
        def show_ninja(request, ninja):
         #ninja got passed in through the url parameter!
         context = {'myninja' : ninja}
         return render(request, '/myproject/showmyninja.html', context)

In our templates:
        <!-- From inside /myproject/showmyninja.html -->
        {{myninja}}


Route Parameters

In our urls.py file:

        # Inside apps/appname/urls.py might look like this:
        from django.conf.urls import url
        from . import views
        urlpatterns = [
         url(r'^/en/(?P<djangoversion>[0-9]\.[0-9])/topics/http/urls/$', views.index)
        ]

In our views.py file:

          from django.shortcuts import render, HttpResponse, redirect
          # Create your views here.
          def index(request, djangoversion):
           print(djangoversion) # will result in a string e.g. "1.9"
           print("hello, I am your first request")
           return HttpResponse('hello')
